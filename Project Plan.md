## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Project Objectives

The project is focused on creating a user-friendly graphical interface for the Nutritional Food Database. This interface makes it easier for users to access and understand detailed nutritional information. It features advanced search tools that allow users to filter and analyze data based on food type, nutrient content, and nutritional density. These tools help users get the specific information they need for informed dietary decisions.

Additionally, the project includes visual aids like pie charts and bar graphs to clearly show the nutritional breakdown of foods. This visual approach helps users understand the data better, supporting informed choices about their diet. The tool also serves as a valuable resource for dietitians, researchers, and educators, improving dietary planning and nutritional education. By making nutritional information easy to access and understand, the tool encourages healthier eating habits, aiming to enhance public health outcomes.

### 1.2 Project Stakeholders

**Internal Stakeholders:**
* Company Executives oversee the project to ensure it aligns with the company’s goals. They focus on how the project can improve the company’s performance and reputation.

* Programmers and Designers work on building the software. They combine technical expertise with creative design (UI/UX )to ensure the tool is both effective and appealing.

* Marketing Team works to get the tool noticed. They create campaigns that explain the benefits of the tool to attract and keep users.

* Quality Assurance Team tests the software thoroughly to make sure this tool works perfectly and meets all user needs before it goes live.

**Potential End-Users:**
* Dietitians, Nutritionists, and Healthcare Professionals use the tool to get accurate nutritional information, which helps them give better advice to their clients and patients.

* Researchers and Educators use the tool to enrich their academic and educational projects. It provides them with a reliable source of nutritional data that enhances learning and research activities.

* The General Public includes anyone interested in learning more about their food choices. The tool provides them with clear nutritional information, helping them make healthier decisions.

### 1.3 Project Scope

### Project Scope

**In-Scope (Included in the Project):**

- **User Interface Design:**

  Developing a desktop graphical user interface (GUI) that is intuitive and user-friendly, allowing users to interact with the nutritional database.

- **Core Functionalities:**
  - Food Search: Implementing a feature that allows users to search for foods by name and display all associated nutritional information.
  - Nutrition Breakdown: Enabling users to view pie charts and bar graphs showing the breakdown of different nutrients for a selected food item.
  - Nutrition Range Filter: Providing a tool for users to filter foods based on a specific nutrient within a user-defined minimum and maximum range.
  - Nutrition Level Filter: Allowing users to categorize and filter foods by nutritional content levels—low, mid, and high—based on predefined thresholds.
  - Additional Feature: Developing an extra feature (to be defined by the project team) for analyzing and visualizing the dataset in a meaningful way.

- **Data Integration:**

  Integrating the provided nutritional database with the application to ensure users can access and analyze the data effectively.

- **Visual Aids:**

  Incorporating graphical elements such as pie charts and bar graphs to help users visualize the nutritional data clearly.

- **Testing and Quality Assurance:**

  Performing thorough testing of the software to ensure all features work as expected and meet user requirements. Conducting usability testing to ensure the interface is easy to use and intuitive.

- **Documentation and Version Control:**
  - Documenting the design, development process, and user instructions for the application.
  - Hosting the project on a private GitHub repository, with regular commits to track the incremental and collaborative efforts of the team.

**Out-of-Scope (Excluded from the Project):**

- **Mobile Application Development:**
  
  The project will not involve creating a mobile version of the application. The focus will be exclusively on desktop software.

- **Database Expansion:**
 
  The project will not include the creation or modification of the nutritional database. It will use the provided dataset as-is.

- **Third-Party Integrations:**
  
  Integrating with third-party services or external databases is not part of this project.

- **Advanced Data Analytics:**
  
  The project will not include complex data analytics beyond the basic filtering, searching, and visualization features outlined in the scope.

- **Post-Project Maintenance:**
  
  Ongoing maintenance, updates, or support after the project delivery is not included. The project will end with the delivery of the fully functional desktop application.


## 2. Work Breakdown Structure

Include the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) for the entire project. WBS should be presented as a hierarchical diagram. Use the elements from the WBS to define activities in Section 3, and schedule these activities in the Gantt Chart in Section 4. Ensure all project activities are considered and included in the WBS.

## 3. Activity Definition Estimation

Define the activities required for your project based on the WBS, and assign responsibilities to team members. Each activity should be numbered and correspond with your Gantt chart. Provide estimated durations for each activity to facilitate Gantt chart preparation.

| Activity #No | Activity Name | Brief Description | Duration | Responsible Team Members |
|--------------|---------------|-------------------|----------|--------------------------|
| xxx          | xxx           | xxx               | xxx      | xxx \& yyy               |
| xxxx         | xxx           | xxx               | xxx      | All                      |
| xxxx         | xxx           | xxx               | xxx      | xxx                      |

## 4. Gantt Chart
You have to use the provided Gantt chart template.  

Use the provided Gantt chart template to list all items from the Activity Definition along with relevant estimates 
and scheduling. Ensure that the Gantt chart reflects the activity definitions from Section 3. Track actual start 
times and durations. Besides including Gantt chart here, you should also submit your Gantt chart file separately.
